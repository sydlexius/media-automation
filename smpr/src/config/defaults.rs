// `*_STEMS` are matched as substrings (word.contains(stem)); `*_EXACT` is
// whole-word (\bword\b). `cum`/`cock`/`pussy` live as EXACT, not stems: as
// substrings they flag innocent words (scum, tecum, cumberland, circumvent,
// peacock, pussycat, cockapoo, and Latin "tecum/cum" in the Ave Maria). Common
// genuine inflections are kept as exact entries so true hits aren't lost.
//
// The exact-vs-stem choice is asymmetric by compound productivity:
//   - `shit` stays a STEM. It is highly productive in English compounds
//     (dipshit, batshit, horseshit, chickenshit, shitshow, shitload, shittin,
//     shite, ...); making it exact would silently miss any compound not
//     enumerated, and a missed profanity is the worse failure for a parental
//     tool than a rare false positive. Its few substring collisions on
//     non-English tokens (romaji `-shite` te-forms like kaoshite/shitemo/
//     haidashite, and crashity) are suppressed via FALSE_POSITIVES instead.
//   - `slut` is EXACT. It has almost no productive compounds, and the sole
//     observed collision (`beslut`, Scandinavian for "decision") is eliminated
//     structurally by the word boundary, so exact is safe here.
